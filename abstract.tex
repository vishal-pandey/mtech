	IoT is a field that combines the capability of two domains: computer science and electronics. IoT devices are basically sensor nodes (usually wireless) connected to each other and to the central control system through the internet. Various applications IoT is in healthcare, weather monitoring, remote control, collecting data from sensors. Missing data in the wireless sensor network is inevitable and is a major field of study since the start of IoT and WSN. IoT operates in technologies which are lossy networks. There may be many reasons for the loss of data while communication one of the reason may be confession the other reason being a loss in tunning of duty cycles of sender and receiver and other environmental condition in which they operate. Recovering the lost data is important in mission-critical applications such as health care, defense etc. In IoT networks to overcome these issues and regenerate the data machine learning techniques can prove to be beneficial since the IoT networks have constraint devices so robust and complex techniques do not fit in their communication model.   \\
