The proposed model of using transfer learning in wireless sensor network data increases the effeciency of the forecasting and imputation. It also reduces the training time which makes it more feasible for online training and for real-time scenario.\\

The result in the previous chapter shows that it make more feasible to train such model with transfer learning in comparision to the building one from scratch. MSE loss shows that more accuracy can be achieved with less data where WSN is not generating much data for applying the deep learning.
